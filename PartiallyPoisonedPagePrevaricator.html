aka <a style="color:#204A87" href="#feraldataspace">FeralDataspace</a>

even in the absence of efficient poisoned-cacheline injectors for using RAS-capable pipelines for lazy/eager parallelism, we can use the old unmapped-page VM basics to micro-manage memory residence/ownership at the cacheline level

non-blocking methods (may lodge an interrupt, but will never sleep) may perhaps need to parallel any page/etc methods which might otherwise sleep

grow a superclass of page/msg/blk/skb/etc _ops which have such variants (maybe same as old) and other archidongles, and itchingly some bpf/etc gates

atf/parent context dances the data in/out of cache by emu or stepping for remainer of thunk, then continues with cache populated but page otherwise still poisoned

this dance may include omnixtend or journaling state to nvme objects of task state. may fit well with computation stg ideas, as well as migration

see Chapel language for something to throw into the ebpf/p4/vulkan/go semantic stew, too

looks like a good adjunct to the <a style="color:#204A87" href="#feralargspace">FeralArgspace</a> project
