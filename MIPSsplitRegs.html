explore a minimal vehicle for heterogeneous OS actors by extending MIPS's 2-register reservation for page-fault handling.
Take an embedded ecosystem like OpenWRT, rebuild with more than the standard 2-reg (r25/r26 IIRC) exclusion from gcc's playthings.

This models in a minimal way, on legacy hardware, the possibilities of having ubiquitous cache-coherent actors within PCI/etc fabric, as one might later come to expect from an NVMe/comp.stg architecture, or ebpf-capable processors attached to a system's DMA devices.
Typical eBPF/etc actors would have greater capabilities, so this represents a minimal existence proof for proposed features

Assess code ballooning from building C/etc components with reduced registers, gather footprint data on the asm-specified pieces which use the now-forbidden registers.

Adding 2 regs might be sufficient, so the NMIs for page-fault would now have 4 registers to play with.

As before these exceptions
<ul><li dir="ltr">must be idempotent and interruptible, they should be harmless if aborted or re-executed, but once they have run to completion the previous context can make progress by advancing PC at least one instruction
</li><li dir="ltr">may now address more complex goals, like
<ul><li dir="ltr"> SDEI insertion
</li><li dir="ltr">cache-coherency state-machine transitions
</li><li dir="ltr">RAS handling (poisoned cacheline wrangling)
</li><li dir="ltr">swizzling .mcount-level properties</li></ul></li></ul>
